We need CLI commands for:
	- starting app in long running process
		- index.php is a cli-invoked script takes the name of the main class, runs static checks, starts queue worker, calls [orchestrate on that main class] inside our event loop

Named renderers for the purpose of portable links that don't break in transit
	- only way this can work is by searching while building the full route tree
Url map generation
	- if it's not the end of the thread (contains a _prefixFor), we create a sub to contain the patterns below it

sqlite

	- Illuminate\Testing\TestResponse: overwrite these in our extension
		- assertSee[x] (they need the `e` method)
		- assertView[x] (needs to convert our view to their View and pass that as response to testResponseBridge)

Wrap:
	- debug_backtrace

==when doesn't work==
	- crud:
		- index: use "_index" instead of leaving it blank
		- line 102
			- doesn't this return a regex that should be escaped/normalized? if that be the case, match incoming path against that pattern and return the result to this guy

	- flows:
		- finding in cache after job runs, consider delegating path fetching to outerFlowWrapper->dataPath (although there's a chance that prefix wasn't even added in the hydrator, see line 84)
		- [OuterFlowWrapperTest->test_empties_cache_entry_after_returning], write a sub test that checks the cache directly to confirm it was removed

	- tests:
		- mocks injected into modules => relevant test should create mock and manually trigger module booting before it runs. But first, check whether prophecy will work

	- conditional factory
		- [finally] => consider making factoryList a numeric array


test only and except from routeCollection


4) pending tests:
	- contracts\config
		- auth, router, tss


	- connect AlertAdapter/Bugsnag in interface loader
	- typesense search adapter
		- indexing on model save/update
		- converting from/to orm type during retrieval
		- passing to collection type
	- write and connect laravel cache adapter
	- ModuleInitializer -> laravel route finders, replace with insertable generics like for the container



what would be a really valuable test is visiting flows defined in 3 from 1 ie. full get
	- MultiModuleTest->test_handle_flows_in_other_modules transfer flow routes in FlowRoutes to another module


write tests for
	- TransphpormTest
	- RoutedRendererManager->handleValidRequest check whether it's necessary to inject updates from higher-ups (middleware) or if they'll receive it anyway (thanks to reference)

create argument allowing us replace uploaded files and filesystem on the operator
- multiEdit cloaker should complain on get if no authorization is found


Move methods on CheckProvisionedClasses to telescope

is gagsException analogous to investigateSystemCrash? how do they relate

correct resque adapter bin-include path



why aren't we using midlewareManipulator
