We need CLI commands for:
	- starting app in long running process
		- index.php is a cli-invoked script takes the name of the main class, runs static checks, starts queue worker, calls [orchestrate on that main class] inside our event loop

Named renderers for the purpose of portable links that don't break in transit
	- only way this can work is by searching while building the full route tree
Url map generation
	- if it's not the end of the thread (contains a _prefixFor), we create a sub to contain the patterns below it

		- assertView[x] (needs to convert our view to their View and pass that as response to testResponseBridge)

Wrap:
	- debug_backtrace



test only and except from routeCollection


4) pending tests:
	- contracts\config
		- auth, router, tss


	- connect AlertAdapter/Bugsnag in interface loader
	- typesense search adapter
		- indexing on model save/update
		- converting from/to orm type during retrieval
		- passing to collection type
	- write and connect laravel cache adapter
	- ModuleInitializer -> laravel route finders, replace with insertable generics like for the container



write tests for
	- TransphpormTest

create argument allowing us replace uploaded files and filesystem on the operator
- multiEdit cloaker should complain on get if no authorization is found
