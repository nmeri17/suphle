We need CLI commands for:
	- starting app in long running process
		- index.php is a cli-invoked script takes the name of the main class, runs static checks, starts queue worker, calls [orchestrate on that main class] inside our event loop

Named renderers for the purpose of portable links that don't break in transit
	- only way this can work is by searching while building the full route tree
Url map generation
	- if it's not the end of the thread (contains a _prefixFor), we create a sub to contain the patterns below it

sqlite
<server name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
